# EFT-Single-Player-Tarkov-Vortex-Extension
This is an Extension for the Vortex Modding platform Created by Nexus Mods that allows you to use Vortex to manage your Single Player Tarkov mods.

Please Pardon the mess, This is all new to me from the Developer side.

Installing/Updating the extension, 
>go to the "Extensions" List in the Vortex app,
>click on the button in the bottom right and select the zip file you downloaded, "Vortex Extension Update - Escape From Tarkov - Single Player Tarkov Mod Vortex Extension Vx.x.x".

>Restart Vortex 
>Search the "Extensions" List, if you see it, it successfuly installed, If not, Repeat install and restart. (I do not know why the double install is needed sometimes)

Unfortunately, It is not completely hands off if you want to take advantage of all the features of Vortex, Dependencies and the Variants systems.
